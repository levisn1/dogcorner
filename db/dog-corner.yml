She is spayed and microchipped and up to date on her shots. This sweet lass is good with children and other dogs, but is not crate trained. April was such a sad case. She was found as a stray with a large growth and a badly infected tail. The Antioch Shelter took care of all her medical work , including removal of the benign (non cancerous) growth, tail amputation and spay. They also groomed her. For the first time in a very long time April felt normal again, without pain and discomfort. She was fostered overnight with a shelter volunteer who reports that she did well with children and other dogs. Right now she is doing well in a multiple dog household. April is on a medical hold while she rehabilitates from her surgery. ",

  description: "Benny comes off as polite and shy, but as he has gotten comfy in his foster family's home and routine, he is gaining confidence and becoming quite the sweet clown. He is gentle and affectionate. He plays a lot with Eric (another Wonder dog available now!) - they dance around and cuddle in exhaustion! Benny is great on leash and loves when he sees you grab the leash. If you are just relaxing - he's fine with that too. He is not pushy or aggressive - he's just happy to be with you whether working out or hanging at the house. He is shy in a busy dog park situation and will stay with you looking for calm in the dog park storm. He will be shy with you, initially, but he warms up in a few days. He does like to get under your covers at night, fyi. ",

This beautiful dog with her sparkling white teeth is probably just a year of age and she’s friendly, sweet and playful. We have not tested her around cats at this point. Here with her San Francisco foster parent, Snow has been learning about potty training and how to walk on a leash and she is making good progress. Snow will make a wonderful companion for some lucky family ",
